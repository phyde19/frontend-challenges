# Frontend Challenge Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various frontend development challenges. Each challenge focuses on creating isolated components and interfaces to improve UI/UX engineering skills.

## Purpose

The main goals of this project are:

1. To practice and refine frontend development skills
2. To explore different UI/UX patterns and implementations
3. To build a portfolio of reusable components and solutions

## Structure

Each challenge is contained in its own directory, named after the component or interface being implemented. For example:


Within each directory, you'll find:

- The source code for the solution
- A README describing the challenge and any notable implementation details
- (Optional) A screenshot or demo of the final result

## Technologies

The challenges primarily use:

- Next.js
- React
- Tailwind CSS

Additional libraries or tools may be used in specific challenges and will be noted in the respective README files.

## Running the Projects

Most projects can be run using the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
